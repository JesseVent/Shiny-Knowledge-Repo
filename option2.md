IoT devices generate a lot of sequential data over time, also called
time series data. Legacy portrayals of such data would centre around
line charts. Line charts have reportedly been around since the early
1700s (source: Wikipedia) and we have nothing against them. They
facilitate trend detection and comparison, are simple to draw, and easy
to understand; all in all a very well behaved visualisation. In modern
times, their use is widespread from the heartbeat monitor at a hospital
to the multiple-monitor display at a traderâ€™s desk.
